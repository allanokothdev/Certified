## Problem

Certified is a platform that aims to solve the problem of inauthentic, fraudulent certificates. There are many instances where people may try to present false or forged certificates in order to gain an advantage, whether it be in education, employment, or other areas. This can be a problem for the organizations that issue the certificates, as well as for the individuals who rely on the authenticity of the certificates for various purposes. Not only does this undermine the integrity of the education system, but it can also have serious consequences if individuals with fake credentials are able to obtain professional roles for which they are not qualified.

Certified uses blockchain technology to help verify the authenticity of certificates and other documents, which can help to reduce the risk of fraud and ensure that the information contained in the certificates is accurate and reliable.

## Solution

Certified, uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) technology to store authenticated certificates, addresses the problem of fake certificates. By making it easier for HR professionals to verify the authenticity of an applicant's credentials, organizations can ensure that they are hiring qualified individuals and reducing the risk of hiring someone with fake credentials.
